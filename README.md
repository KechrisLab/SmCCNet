## Overview

SmCCNet is a framework that adeptly integrates single or multiple omics
data types along with a quantitative or binary phenotype of interest. It
offers a streamlined setup process that can be tailored manually or
configured automatically, ensuring a flexible and user-friendly
experience. The algorithm is based on sparse multiple canonical analysis
(SmCCA) and is designed for $T$ omics data types $X_1, X_2, ..., X_T$
along with a quantitative phenotype $Y$. SmCCA identifies canonical
weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_T$ that maximize the sum of pairwise canonical
correlations between the omics data and $Y$, subject to certain
constraints. In SmCCNet, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator) is used as the sparsity constraint function.

The algorithm can operate in both weighted and unweighted modes,
depending on whether $a_{i,j}$ and $b_i$ (scaling factors) are equal or
not. When $a_{i,j}$ and $b_i$ are not all equal, it corresponds to the
weighted version; otherwise, it corresponds to the unweighted version,
where $a_{i,j} = b_i = 1$ for all $i$ and $j$.

The sparsity penalties $c_t$ determine the number of features included
in each subnetwork. SmCCNet follows a workflow that involves creating a
network similarity matrix using SmCCA canonical weights from repeated
subsampled omics data and the phenotype. It then identifies multi-omics
modules relevant to the phenotype. The subsampling scheme enhances
network robustness by analyzing a subset of omics features multiple
times and aggregating results from each subsampling step.Below are the
four steps of SmCCNet workflow

- Step I: Determine SmCCA sparsity penalties $c_t$. The user can select
  the penalties for omics feature selection based on the study purpose
  and/or prior knowledge. Alternatively, one can pick sparsity penalties
  based on a K-fold cross validation (CV) procedure that minimizes the
  total prediction error. The K-fold CV procedure ensures selected
  penalties to be generalizable to similar independent data sets and
  prevents over-fitting.
- Step II: Randomly subsample omics features without replacement, apply
  SmCCA with chosen penalties, and compute a feature relationship matrix
  for each subset. Repeat the process many times and define the
  similarity matrix to be the average of all feature relationship
  matrices.
- Step III: Apply hierarchical tree cutting to the similarity matrix to
  find the multi-omics networks. This step simultaneously identifies
  multiple subnetworks.
- Step Iv: Prune and summarize each network with our network pruning
  algorithm.

# Package Functions

The older version of the SmCCNet package includes four (external)
functions:

- **getRobustPseudoWeights()**: Compute aggregated (SmCCA) canonical
  weights.
- **getAbar()**: Calculate similarity matrix based on canonical weights.
- **getMultiOmicsModules()**: Perform hierarchical tree cutting on the
  similarity matrix and extract clades with multi-omics features.
- **plotMultiOmicsNetwork()**: Plot (pruned or full) multi-omics
  subnetworks.

In the updated package, all functions except for **getAbar** are retired
from the package, additional functions have been added to the package to
perform single-/multi-omics SmCCNet with quantitative/binary phenotype,
and their use is illustrated in this vignette:

- **aggregateCVSingle()**: Saving cross-validation result as the
  cross-validation table into the working directory and provide
  recommendation on the penalty term selection.
- **classifierEval()**: Evaluate binary classifierâ€™s performance with
  respect to user-selected metric (accuracy, auc score, precision,
  recall, f1).
- **dataPreprocess()**: A simple pipeline to preprocess the data before
  running SmCCNet (center, scale, coefficient of variation filtering and
  regressing out covariates).
- **fastAutoSmCCNet()**: Automated SmCCNet automatically identifies the
  project problem (single-omics vs multi-omics), and type of analysis
  (CCA for quantitative phenotype vs.Â PLS for binary phenotype) based on
  the input data that is provided. This method automatically preprocess
  data, choose scaling factors, subsampling percentage, and optimal
  penalty terms, then runs through the complete SmCCNet pipeline without
  the requirement for users to provide additional information. This
  function will store all the subnetwork information to a user-provided
  directory, as well as return all the global network and evaluation
  information. Refer to the automated SmCCNet vignette for more
  information.
- **getCanWeightsMulti()**: Run Sparse Multiple Canonical Correlation
  Analysis (SmCCA) and return canonical weight.
- **getCanCorMulti()**: Get canonical correlation value for SmCCA given
  canonical weight vectors and scaling factors.
- **getRobustWeightsMulti()**: SmCCNet algorithm with multi-omics data
  and quantitative phenotype. Calculate the canonical weights for SmCCA.
- **getRobustWeightsMultiBinary()**: SmCCNet algorithm with multi-omics
  data and binary phenotype. First, SmCCA is used to identify
  relationship between omics (exlude phenotype). Then, after highly
  connected omics features are selected in step 1, SPLSDA is used to
  identify relationships between these omics features and phenotype(s).
  The sparse PLSDA algorithm for binary outcome first compute PLS by
  assuming outcome is continuous, and extracts multiple latent factors,
  then uses latent factors to fit the logistic regression, and weights
  latent factor by regression parameters.
- **getRobustWeightsSingle()**: Compute aggregated (SmCCA) canonical
  weights for single omics data with quantitative phenotype.
- **getRobustWeightsSingleBinary()**: Compute aggregated (SmCCA)
  canonical weights for single omics data with binary phenotype.
- **getOmicsModules()**: Perform hierarchical tree cutting on the
  similarity matrix and extract clades with omics features.
- **networkPruning()**: Extract summarization scores (the first 3
  NetSHy/regular prinicipal components) for specified network module
  with given network size. The omics features will be ranked based on
  PageRank algorithm, then the top $m$ omics features (where $m$ is the
  specified subnetwork size) will be included into the final subnetwork
  to generate the summarization score. For the PC score, the correlation
  with respect to the phenotype of interest will be calculated and
  stored. In addition, the correlation between individual omics features
  and the detected phenotype (with the **Pheno** argument) will also be
  recorded. The final subnetwork adjacency matrix will be stored into
  the user-specified working directory of interest.
- **scalingFactorInput()**: After inputing the annotation of omics data,
  it uses prompts to ask the user to supply the scaling factor intended
  for the SmCCNet algorithm to prioritize the correlation structure of
  interest. All scaling factor values supplied should be numeric and
  nonnegative.
- **summarizeNetSHy()**: Implement NetSHy network summarization via a
  hybrid approach to summarize network by considering the network
  topology with the Laplacian matrix.

## Installation

# Install package
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KechrisLab/SmCCNet")
# Load package
library(SmCCNet)
```

## Usage

We present below examples of how to execute Automated SmCCNet using a
simulated dataset. In this demonstration, we simulate four datasets: two
omics data and one phenotype data. We cover four cases in total,
involving combinations of single or multi-omics data with either a
quantitative or binary phenotype. The final case demonstrates the use of
the regress-out approach for covariate adjustment. If users want to run
through the pipeline step-by-step or understand more about the algorithm
used, please refer to SmCCNet single or multi-omics vignettes for
details.
