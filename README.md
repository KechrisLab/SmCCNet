# SmCCNet
A canonical correlation analysis based method for discovering (quantitative) trait-specific heterogeneous regulatory networks.

SmCCNet is a data integration method based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). It allows the integration of multiple data types and a quantitaive phenotypic trait. This method also includes a subsampling scheme of features to improve the robustness of the canonical weights. 

In the **vignettes** folder, users can find a documentation that illustrates how to implement SmCCNet with an example data set. The data file is included under the **data** folder.
